|** languages.mac
This macro checks what languages you have but are not 100 and spams until you are 100 skill. If you are missing a language, this macro will report which language you need a point in and skip that language.

USAGE: This macro isn't perfect and requires a slight set up before it will work. First, find your Main Chat window, right click on its titlebar and choose "Always chat here". Next, ensure that
you are grouped, even having a merc out and on passive is sufficient.  If you're a dumbass, you should run this macro while AFK in a busy zone.

History:
Version 1.10 -- 25 Mar 2013 gSe7eN: added check to see if we've learned a new language so we can update our math and consider this new language.
Version 1.00 -- 25 Mar 2013 gSe7eN: initial code
